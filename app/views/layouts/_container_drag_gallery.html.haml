          In the U.S., the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease is a very real problem. Many STDs are asymptomatic until they are advanced. Getting tested is incredibly important for maintaining overall health as well as sexual health. Many people are tempted to ignore an STD in the hopes that it will go away on its own. With some STDs, though, there isnâ€™t a progression of symptoms; the disease could go from symptomless to life-threatening with nothing in between.
